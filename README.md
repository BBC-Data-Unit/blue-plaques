In September 2016 [football legend Laurie Cunningham was honoured with a blue plaque at his childhood home.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37428463)

Dan Wainwright created an [interactive map](https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel.wainwright4535#!/vizhome/BlueplaquesintheUK/Dashboard1) for the story: **Who has a blue plaque where you live?**

## Data

* [Blue plaques in the UK](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/blue-plaques/blob/master/Blue%20plaques%20in%20the%20UK.csv) - a subset of the data available on [Open Plaques](http://openplaques.org/)

## Visualisation

* Interactive map: [Who has a blue plaque where you live?](https://public.tableau.com/profile/daniel.wainwright4535#!/vizhome/BlueplaquesintheUK/Dashboard1)
* **Anna Noble** created a Tableau dashboard using the data from this repo: [Only 6% of blue plaques awarded in the UK honour women](https://public.tableau.com/profile/anna.noble#!/vizhome/DJUK16-UKblueplaquesviz/Navigation). [Read a blog post on how Anna used the data in a session on data visualisation](http://www.thedataschool.co.uk/anna-noble/sexism-blue-plaque-data-viz-djuk16/) at the [Data Journalism UK 2016 conference](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2016/10/24/data-journalism-conference-uk/).
