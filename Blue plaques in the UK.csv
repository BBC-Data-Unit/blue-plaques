The word hospital used to mean lodging house, a place where ""hospitality"" was provided. The original 1602 building was provided by John Manners after an initiative by Bess of Hardwick with the 1597 approval of Queen Elizabeth I.
The current building dates from 1709 and houses six separate homes, hence the six front doors you see today. The homes had one tiny room downstairs and one upstairs - no bathroom, toilet or kitchen,
The Manners family, Dukes of  Rutland from 1703, maintained the building until 1920. They gave it and the adjacent former town hall to the trustees who had been running the charity. The town hall was sold at a 1966 auction for Â£1,137. 
Financial problems caused the homes to become derelict and unfit for habitation by 2001. They were rescued and restored by the trustees in 2004-6 at a cost of Â£325,000, which was raised through donations and grants.
There are now three larger homes, combining modern facilities with many historical features.

At the end of the War in 1946 the camp housed ex-soldiers of the free Polish Armed Forces transferred to the Polish Resettlement Corps. The Corps offered further education and job training to enable the troops to enter British civilian life.
In 1948 the camp converted to civilian use housing Polish families and their dependants displaced by the War. Many of the Poles settled in the locality and the wider Yorkshire area.

1,Guildford,blue,United Kingdom,,8710,"Guildford House Guildford House, now the town's art gallery, is a rare example of a Restoration town house. John Child, a wealthy London attorney, began its construction in 1660, incorporating parts of an existing timber-framed building. It uses classical features in the style made fashionable by Inigo Jones. John Child has been born in 1629, the son of a Buckinghamshire gentleman, and rose to prominence in Guildford, where he served as mayor in 1676, 1681 and 1691. The house seems to have been built in two phases, the first in the early 1660s and then in the 1680s. The magnificent staircase belongs to this latter phase, and echoes the work of the great wood-carver Grinling Gibbons. The plaster ceilings, panelling and elaborate window ironwork all indicate that this was a house of a gentleman of taste and wealth. In 1736 the Childs sold the house to the Martyr family. They, too, were lawyers and were known as the hereditary Town Clerks of Guildford. The Martyrs made several alterations to the house, including the panelling in the first-floor front room. This was known as the Sheriff's Parlour (now the Powell Room), where the Martyrs entertained the Sheriff of Surrey. and the judges when the assizes were held in Guildford. It may also have been the Martyrs who clad the rear of the house with 'mathematical' tiles, which give the impression of brickwork. The house became a shop in 1841. The entrance steps were removed and bay windows inserted at street level. Passing through several owners, it became Nuthall's Restaurant in 1930.

Posnett, the owner of Highfield and Camden tanneries, purchased the Canal Street ground in 1918, which had been used previously by the town's rugby team. Runcorn A.F.C. was formed in the same year, as part of the Highfield and Camden Tanneries Recreation Club, hence the team's early nickname of 'The Tanners'. The team continued to be run under the umbrella of the tanneries until 1953, when it became Runcorn A.F.C. Ltd.

Runcorn A.F.C., later nicknamed 'The Linnets' because of the green colour in their home kits, were a major force in non-League football. The peak of the team's success was winning the Alliance Premier League in 1982. However, they could not apply for election to the Football League because their ground did not meet League requirements. Just five seasons later, this system of voting teams into the Football League was replaced by automatic promotion, but it was too late to help Runcorn A.F.C., who were no longer the great side they once were.

In the 1993-94 season, a perimeter wall collapsed during an F.A. Cup tie with Hull City, the main stand was destroyed by fire, and the roof of another stand blew off during heavy winds. These events, together with poor form on the pitch, sent the club into a downward spiral, and in 2000 the club sold its Canal Street ground that had been its home since 1918. This was a great disappointment to fans, and caused a general feeling of loss in the town. The Linnets Park housing estate now stands on the former site of the ground.

In 2006 Runcorn A.F.C. ceased activity, but fans of the team formed a new club called Runcorn Linnets, who play at The Millbank Linnets Stadium in Murdishaw.

The earliest charter for a ferry dates from this year, and belonged to Richard de Mora (of Moore). This charter is extant and is held in Halton Borough Council's archive. The original ferry service operated from an area at the bottom of Mersey Street known as the Old Gut or Boat House Pool, to Woodend in Widnes. The construction of shipbuilding yards in this area at the beginning of the 19th Century necessitated a change in location for the ferry, and so about 1803 a new site was established downriver in front of Runcorn Parish Church (replaced in 1849 by All Saints' Church). The building of the Runcorn Railway Bridge in 1868 with its pedestrian walkway, led to a decline in passenger traffic for the ferry, and the service finally ceased in 1905 with the construction of the Transporter Bridge. This building was once a public house called The Ferry Boat. It became the Boat House Inn in 1825, and it stands close to the site of the original ferry crossing. The building was used concurrently as a packet house, possibly from as early as the late 18th Century, following the completion of the Bridgewater Canal around that time.

During the 18th Century, quarrying became an important industry in Runcorn, with quarries at Weston, Mill Brow, Stenhills and several other sites. The industry reached its peak towards the end of the 19th Century, but by the beginning of WWII, quarrying in the town was all but finished. Runcorn sandstone had a beautiful, distinctive reddish-pink colour, and was respected by people in the industry because of the high quality of the stone.

Runcorn sandstone has been used in many buildings in Runcorn and Widnes, other towns and cities in the United Kingdom, as well as countries across the world. Some famous buildings made completely or partially from our sandstone include Runcorn Railway Bridge, Norton Water Tower, Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, Chester Cathedral, Tatton Hall in Knutsford, and the docks at Belfast, New York, and San Francisco.

Herbert Austin was born on 8th November 1866.

He always had a passion for cars and successfully managed the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company in Birmingham.
Under his direction Wolseley cars won international renown.

In 1905 he decided that it was time to start his own company, buying the former White and Pike factory
site for Â£7,750, so motor manufacturing began at Longbridge.

During the First World War the company expanded to over 20,000 employees - producing a diverse range of materials, including 2,000 fighter aircraft.

In 1917, recognising the Austin Motors contribution to the war effort, Herbert Austin was knighted.

He was elected MP in 1918 for King's Norton, Birmingham, and office he held for six years.

In the 1936 Honours List Sir Herbert Austin was created a Baron and elevated to the peerage.
He took the title of Lord Austin of Longbridge.

This church was founded in 1344 by Queen Isabella widow of King Edward II, on land called 'Babblake' and was granted by her to the Guild of St. John the Baptist. It was to be served by two chaplains from the 'College of Bablake'. Those priests were to say a daily mass for, the repose of the soul of her late husband King Edward II, her son King Edward III, her daughter in law Queen Phiippa, her grandson Edward the Black Prince and members of the Guild of St. John. The building was consecrated on 2nd May 1350 to God and St. John the Baptist.

By the time of the dissolution of the Guilds in 1548, the church was closed and given to the Mayor of the Corporation. During the time of the Commonwealth (1642-1660), the church was used as a prison for Royalist soldiers captured at the Battle of Preston. As the sympathies of the citizens of Coventry lay with the Parliamentarians, they gave the Royalist prisoners a hostile reception
giving rise to the saying 'sent to Coventry', meaning that someone is ignored or treated coldly. After many years lying empty,
occasionally being used to hold markets and as a stretch yard for dyed cloth, the Corporation agreed to reopen the church as a place
of worship. It was created a Parish Church on 24th July 1734.

1,Guildford,blue,United Kingdom,,8709,"Somerset House Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662-1748), was known as the 'Proud Duke'. He would often stay overnight in Guildford when travelling between London and his seat at Petworth. It is said that his irascible nature led him to quarrel with every inn-keeper in the town. Eventually he decided to buy his own house, just outside borough boundary. It is a good example of the contemporary Queen Anne style, with fine brickwork and a gable and entrance steps in the Dutch manner. It was extensively refurbished in 1847, but remained a private house until the 1920s, when shop fronts were knocked through the street frontage on either side of the entrance steps. The upper High Street has had various names in the past, most notably Spital Street. This was short for Hospital Street, and referred to an ancient leper hospital which stood at the junction of the London and Epsom Roads until the 1840s. An alderman's wife, Mrs Quittenton, considered the name improper and in 1901 led a successful campaign to have it changed to 'Upper High Street'. In 1961 it was formally included in the High Street, and all the addresses were renumbered. Across the street, the north side has been almost entirely rebuilt from 1931 onwards, in order to widen the roadway for motor traffic.",51.23636,1662,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Seymour,_6th_Duke_of_Somerset",1748,"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Charles_Seymour,_6th_Duke_of_Somerset.jpg?width=640",Charles Seymour,"Duke of Somerset, father of Algernon Seymour","[""Duke of Somerset"", ""father of Algernon Seymour""]",man,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Seymour,_6th_Duke_of_Somerset",-0.57042,http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7151/6823502125_ea2deb7159_b.jpg,1,Guildford Historic Trail,"[""Guildford Historic Trail""]",,,"[""Charles Seymour|(1662-1748)|man|Duke of Somerset and father of Algernon Seymour|""]"

1,London,blue,United Kingdom,,41098,"The Soldiers Return name came from the days when soldiers would return to the nearby RAF base to convalesce after active service.  RAF Uxbridge occupies the former estate and grounds of the historic Hillingdon House and has an important connection with Britain's air defence during the World War II.  The original Hillingdon House is thought to have been built in 1617 and was rebuilt in 1717 by the last Duke of Schonberg.  Prior to 1717, the estate had been identified as belonging partly to the manor of Swakeleys and partly to the Manor of Colham.  A Medieval settlement within this area was concentrated within te settlements of Hillingdon, Colham and Uxbridge and it is likely that the site lay within common land and wasteland between these.  The current Hillingdon House was rebuilt in 1844 after being destroyed by fire.  In 1907 the gardens covered 47 acres and contained a five-acre lake formed by a dam in the River Pinn.  The park as a while covered approximatley 158 acres with no significant changes by 1914.  The estate was bought by the Government in 1918 an used as a convalescence home for Canadian soldiers after which it became the RFC Armanent and Gunnery School.  In 1919 the RAF Depot relocated from Halton to the site and became the main recruit-training centre.  During the 1920's new barrack blocks around a large parade ground and other buildings were built to accommodate this.  Hillongdon House soon began to house headquarters for units, of which the most notable was No 11 (Fighter) Group who were there from 1936.",51.5681,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hillingdon_Hall,,,Hillingdon Hall,,[],man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillingdon_Hall,-0.44094,http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1629/26151528076_998a7c22fa_z.jpg,2,,[],,,"[""Hillingdon Hall||man||"", ""Hillingdon House||man||""]"

His father was a soldier during the Revolutionary War and Sam Houston served under General Andrew Jackson, later to be the seventh US President, during the War of 1812. He was also during his lifetime Governor of Tennessee.

1,Birmingham,blue,United Kingdom,,11840,"A brief look at the heritage of The Bull
(formerly The Bull's Head)
Price Street, Birmingham 4
By John Ashby

During the middle of the seventeenth century, Birmingham was becoming established as a gun manufacturing centre and in 1689 a government contract was undertaken to produce military small arms. Later in 1693 a larger contract was awarded whereby Birmingham gunsmiths agreed to supply 200 weapons a month for a year. Such contracts resulted in the expansion of the industry, and this caused production to exceed demand. Manufacturers looked for a counter-balance and soon the production of sporting weapons became common. Firearms production was a very specialised trade and initially all the operations were carried out by individual gunsmiths, but as orders increased and different styles of weapons were introduced, people began to specialise in manufacture of the various component parts. 

By the end of the eighteenth century, when the development of the flintlock pistol had been perfected, Birmingham was the foremost arms producer in the world; by some one million items over its nearest rival London, and was employing a few thousand people who in the main worked in a definite area, this became known as the Gun Quarter. 

The Bull's Head is in the Gun Quarter. The exact date of its construction is difficult to determine but Price Street appears to have developed in two sections. Firstly the old street on the corner of which stands number one, the Bull's Head and then the second section called new Buildings, also starting from number one. People who now the area well claim that as early as 1729 there was a gun implement maker residing at No. 1 Price Street. He was also a beer retailer.

It is interesting to compare the trades of some of the occupants of both sections. The older certainly went back to the eighteenth century, and probably the Bullâ€™s Head with it. The newer developed as a result of the rapidly expanding firearms industry. In the old section with its fifty-nine houses and seven courts there were several shopkeepers, two cow keepers, a tea urn  and coal dealer, a marine store dealer, an earthenware dealer and two beer retailers , to name but a few. There were also twenty-two tradesmen associated with the gun trade working in domestic workshops. In the later section all twenty-eight buildings were occupied by gun makers and allied trades. 
Malcolm Bowater, a gun stock maker, is still working in Price Street. He has worked in the area for more than forty years, having been apprenticed at Greenerâ€™s, which stood at the corner of St. Maryâ€™s Row and Loveday Street. People such as Malcolm remember dealers made considerable fortunes from the gun industry at the time of the American Civil War, and there are accounts that they would go to extremes to publicise their wealth. When travelling around the town they would hire two cabs, one for the man and the other for his top hat and cane, 
In the  middle of the 19th century it was common for the â€œgun gafferâ€ to pay their employeeâ€™s wages in the Bullâ€™s Head. This practice inevitable led to much drinking and subsequently much brawling on the saw-dust covered floor. At this time there was a strong catholic community in the Gun Quarter and often the landlord would summon for the local priest to sort out the fighters rather than enlist the services of the â€œPeelersâ€. There was also a resident fiddle player who would continue to play whilst all about him was in complete fiasco. 

Ben Wilde who has been associated with the trade for over fifty years and works in Price Street , has the only gun showroom now open in the Midlands, and is well worth a visit. This sadly reflects on the decline of one of Birminghamâ€™s one time major industries. 
Now, after extensive refurbishment, the pub has been renames The Bull  - and enters another place in history.

This Guildhall was built in 1420 and is the place where William Shakespeare was educated and first witnessed professional theatre. It served as the centre of civic life in Stratford for over 400 years and was the building in which Shakespeare's father, John, served as the town's bailiff.

Built in 1824, it served as one of many prototypes for the New Poor Law of 1834 that saw thousands of workhouses built across the country. The moving spirit behind the project was Revd. J.T. Becher (1769-1848), a noted social reformer. He set out his ideas and strategy to manage the poor in a pamphlet called the Anti-Pauper System. Becher's system was an economic measure (to reduce tax) and a moral crusade (to teach the poor to ask for help only as a last resort.) The help offered was accommodation in the dreaded workhouse, where discipline was exacting, living standards basic and supervision constant. Paupers were divided into men, women, children, vagrants and the sick. Visitors can explore the segregated work yards, dayrooms, dormitories, Master's quarters and cellars and learn about life in The Workhouse.",53.0811,,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edith_Hamilton,,,Edith Hamilton,sister of Alice Hamilton,"[""sister of Alice Hamilton""]",woman,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Hamilton,-0.93922,,1,,[],,,"[""Edith Hamilton||woman|sister of Alice Hamilton|""]"
